# Airbnb Clone Project
I've built a single page Airbnb clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes features like filtering locations, selecting dates, and choosing the number of guests. There's an image gallery modal and a host view with a beautiful host card. This project shows my skills in creating user-friendly web pages with interactive elements.

## Features
- Responsive View
- Iterative Navigation menu
- Iterative calender
- Beautiful host section
- Proper comment & documentation
